# Main-Project-Used-Car-Price-Prediction
Used car price prediction is a machine learning technique that uses a car's features, such as its year, mileage, make, model, and fuel type, to estimate its current market value. The goal is to overcome the difficulties of subjective pricing in the used car market by providing an objective, data-driven valuation for sellers and buyers.
