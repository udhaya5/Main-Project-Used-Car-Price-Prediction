# Main-Project-Used-Car-Price-Prediction
Used car price prediction is a machine learning technique that uses a car's features, such as its year, mileage, make, model, and fuel type, to estimate its current market value. The goal is to overcome the difficulties of subjective pricing in the used car market by providing an objective, data-driven valuation for sellers and buyers.


> 🔬 A data-driven machine learning project that predicts diabetes subtypes using genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project uses a comprehensive dataset encompassing multiple diabetes subtypes, including Steroid‑Induced Diabetes, Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM), Prediabetes, Type 1 Diabetes, and Wolfram Syndrome. The dataset includes medical, genetic, environmental, and lifestyle attributes to provide a holistic view of each patient’s profile. The aim is to help researchers and healthcare professionals understand how these factors interact and contribute to the development and progression of different diabetes subtypes, enabling insights for personalized treatment, risk assessment, and improved disease management.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Predict the diabetes subtype from patient health indicators.  
- Identify key predictors of each subtype.  
- Evaluate multiple models and select the best-performing classifier.
