# Main-Project-Used-Car-Price-Prediction
Used car price prediction is a machine learning technique that uses a car's features, such as its year, mileage, make, model, and fuel type, to estimate its current market value. The goal is to overcome the difficulties of subjective pricing in the used car market by providing an objective, data-driven valuation for sellers and buyers.

> üî¨ A data-driven machine learning project that USED CARS PRICE PREDICTION

---

## üß© Project Overview
The Used Cars Price Prediction project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the resale value of a used car based on various attributes such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and ownership details.
The project involves collecting and analyzing real-world car data, performing feature engineering, and applying regression techniques to predict car prices.
This project aims to help buyers determine fair prices before purchasing a used car and sellers/dealers set competitive yet reasonable selling prices. It also demonstrates the power of data science in solving real-world business problems related to pricing and valuation.

### üéØ Objectives
The main objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the price of a used car. It also aims to understand which factors affect car prices the most and to make the car buying and selling process more transparent and data-driven.

# Model Optimization

Model optimization is a crucial step in improving the accuracy, efficiency, and generalization ability of the used car price prediction model. The goal is to fine-tune the model parameters, enhance feature selection, and minimize errors between predicted and actual car prices.

**Data Preprocessing Optimization**

**Handling Missing Values:** Missing or inconsistent data (e.g., missing mileage or fuel type) were handled using imputation techniques such as mean, median, or mode substitution.

**Outlier Removal:** Outliers in price, mileage, or engine capacity were detected using the IQR (Interquartile Range) or Z-score method to improve model stability.

**Feature Scaling:** Applied StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to normalize numerical features and prevent high-value features (e.g., engine size, mileage) from dominating the model.

**2.Feature Engineering and Selection**
Encoding Categorical Data: Converted categorical variables (like fuel type, transmission, brand) into numeric form using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

**Feature Importance Analysis:** Used Random Forest feature importance and correlation matrix to identify key predictors such as car age, mileage, engine capacity, and brand.

**Dimensionality Reduction:** Implemented PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce redundant features and improve model training efficiency.

**3.Model Selection and Optimization**
- **Baseline Models:** Started with simple models like Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor to establish a baseline performance.

- **Advanced Algorithms:** Implemented and compared advanced models like:

**Random Forest Regressor**

**Gradient Boosting Regressor**

**XGBoost / LightGBM**

**Performance Metrics Used:** Evaluated models using:

**R¬≤ Score**

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

**Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**

**4.Hyperparameter Tuning**
To further enhance model performance, Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV were used to find the best hyperparameters for tree-based models.

**Example Parameters Tuned:**

- For Random Forest: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf

- For XGBoost: learning_rate, n_estimators, max_depth, subsample, colsample_bytree

This tuning helped in minimizing overfitting and improving prediction accuracy.

**5.Cross-Validation**
- Applied K-Fold Cross Validation (usually K=5 or 10) to evaluate model performance on multiple subsets of the data.

- Ensured the model generalizes well to unseen data and prevents overfitting.

**6.Ensemble Optimization**
- Combined multiple models using Ensemble Techniques such as:

- Stacking Regressor

- Voting Regressor

This approach improved robustness and reduced variance in predictions.

**7.Final Model Deployment**
After optimization, the best-performing model (e.g., XGBoost or Random Forest) was selected based on cross-validation results and deployed for real-time price prediction.
